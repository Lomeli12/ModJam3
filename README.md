ModJam 3
=======

Repository for ModJam 3 entry, of which I haven't decided what to make yet.

### How to Compile
##

1. Download the source.
2. **This is only required the first time you compile the mod.** Run `gradlew.bat setupDevWorkspace` (Windows) or `./gradlew setupDevWorkspace` (Unix).
3. Run `gradlew.bat build` (Windows) or `./gradlew build` (Unix)
4. You can find the compiled jar int *build/libs*.
